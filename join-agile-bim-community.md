# Join Agile BIM community

![Agile BIM meetups](.gitbook/assets/agile-bim-meetup.jpg)

We regularly organize [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/collaborative-architecture/) and working groups to discuss agility in the field of architecture and construction. 

There is also an [Agile4bim Linkedin group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/8584849/) to exchange links, case studies, discuss about agile methods, and about our meetings. 

Finally you can contribute to this wiki dedicated to agility in building and construction. To do this, you can modify the content of this [page via Github](https://github.com/sinsunsan/agile-bim-aec) and propose your modifications.
